        <h3>nespresso</h3>In 1975 Eric Favre, an employee of Nestlé, noticed that a coffee bar near the Pantheon in Rome had a disproportionately large number of customers. He found that the only difference between that bar and the many others using the same machines was that operators pumped the piston many times before releasing the coffee, while others did so only once. Oxidization occurs as the pumping action pushes water and air into the ground coffee. This increases the flavor in the coffee and creates the foam seen on top, called crema.[8]</p>

        <h3>Örkény Isvtván</h3>
        <p>One-minute short stories is the title of István Örkény's best-known and certainly most popular volume, but the writings contained in it are considered by many to be genre-defining ones at the same time: short – usually only one or two pages, sometimes only a few lines – grotesque, absurd, mostly humorous short stories with unexpected snaps. The title is an integral part of each one-minute short story, and sometimes it even sharpens the snap. In several cases, a guest text taken out of its original context forms the one-minute story itself – this is especially typical of the writings of the Texts cycle – in other cases the one-minute short story starts as if it were a newspaper story or other everyday text, which then takes a grotesque turn.</p>
